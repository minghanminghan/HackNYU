<h1>Overview</h1>
This is a data visualization project I built in 24 hours for HackNYU.<br>
It's written in Python using MediaPipe, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas yFinance, and Fire.<br>
Recently, I've been very fascinated with the idea of creating interfaces without keyboards. I've been seeing a lot of very cool projects with TouchDesigner:

- [Inspo 2](https://www.instagram.com/p/DFH2j5DROVK)

and it's been a big inspiration behind this project. <br>
I also wanted to learn more about machine learning and computer vision, and data visualization seemed like a very fun intersection of the two. <br>
<br>


<h1>Usage</h1>
1. Pull the repo from Github `git clone ...` <br>
2. Activate the virtual environment: `python venv ...`, `venv/bin/activate` <br>
3. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt` <br>
4. Run `python cli.py --period --interval --symbols` (arguments passed on to yfinance) <br>
5. Have fun!

<h1>Roadmap</h1>
There are many ways to improve on this project. The interface is buggy and limited (one could say hacked together), it only works on a limited set of stocks, it can't stream real-time data, and the practical use cases are quite limited. <br>
I hope that progress for this project doesn't end with HackNYU. I wish to address the major challenges the app faces and try to make something real out of it.
